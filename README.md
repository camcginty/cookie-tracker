# browser-template

A template for starting front-end projects. Webpack for `require` system, build
pipeline, and development server. Boostrap and Handlebars.js included. No
front-end frameworks included.

## Installation

1.  [Download](../../archive/master.zip) this template.
1.  Unzip and rename the template directory.
1.  Empty [`README.md`](README.md) and fill with your own content.
1.  Replace all instances of `ga-wdi-boston.browser-template` with the name of
    your project.
1.  Move into the new project and `git init`.
1.  Install dependencies with `npm install`.

## Structure

Developers should store JavaScript files in [`app/scripts`](app/scripts).
The "manifest" or entry-point is
[`app/scripts/index.js`](app/scripts/index.js). In general, only
application initialization goes in this file. It's normal for developers to
start putting all code in this file, but encourage them to break out different
responsibilities and use the `require` syntax put references where they're
needed.

Developers should set `config.apiOrigins.production` (and
`config.apiOrigins.development` if it differs from the default).  With
`apiOrigins` set, developers may rely on `config.apiOrigin` as the base for API
URLs.

Developers should store styles in [`app/styles`](app/styles) and load them
from [`app/styles/index.scss`](app/styles/index.scss).

Developers should use [getFormFields](forms.md) to retrieve form data to send to
an API.

To deploy a browser-template based SPA, run `grunt deploy`.

## Tasks

Developers should run these often!

-   `grunt nag` or just `grunt`: runs code quality analysis tools on your code
    and complains
-   `grunt make-standard`: reformats all your code in the JavaScript Standard
    Style
-   `grunt <server|serve|s>`: generates bundles, watches, and livereloads
-   `grunt test`: runs any automated tests, depends on `grunt build`
-   `grunt build`: place bundled styles and scripts where `index.html` can find
    them
