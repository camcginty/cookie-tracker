Cookie Brigade is a fundraising organization. It's been operating with as many free resources as possible, including the cookies database. That database has many problems that have been nagging the group for years. By creating my own, I'll be able to customize it to the Brigade's needs and make modifications as necessary.

The hardest part for me on this project was knowing the grand scope of what I want for the Cookie Brigade in the future and paring it down to something manageble for the timeline. I thought I started small enough, but I still had to scrap and abandon things from my original plan. More than one thing I researched to try to implement in my project, but was not able to make work in a reasonable amount of time so I fell back to something I knew I could do and would meet requirements even if it was not what I ultimately wanted for the app. After all, I can keep coming back and adding features as I learn more.

User stories:
A user needs to be able to log in.
A user wants to add their cookies to the database as they bake them.
A user wants to see how many cookies they have made for the event.
A user needs to be able to edit and deletetheir entries.
A viewer of the site wants to know who our organization is and what we do.
