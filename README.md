Cookie Brigade is a fundraising organization. It's been operating with as many free resources as possible, incluidng the cookies database. That database has many problems that have been nagging the gorup for years. By creating my own, I'll be able to customize it to the Brigade's needs and make modifications as necessary.

User stories:
A user needs to be able to log in.
A user wants to add their cookies to the database as they bake them.
A user wants to see how many cookies they have made for the event.
A user needs to be able to edit and deletetheir entries.
A viewer of the site wants to know who our organization is and what we do.
